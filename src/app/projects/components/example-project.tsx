                Example 1: We are a startup in the healthcare industry and 
                we are looking for a team of hackers to help us prototype a solution to a problem. 
                We do not expect you to finish the whole project. We are looking to assess your skills and 
                how you work as a team. We are looking to hire a team of developers to work on our project after the hackathon.

                Example 2: We are a non-profit organization based in Louisville, KY that works with local schools. 
                We are looking for a team to help us prototype a number of solution. We would love to partner with you 
                after the hackathon to continue working on the project. Note: Continuation of the project is not guaranteed.

                Example 1 (narrow): Currently patients in hospitals have their activity tracked by staff on paper and pencil
                on a clipboard located at the front of the bed. This is a challenge for staff to keep track of the patients history in hospital. 
                We would like you to create a &quot;patients&quot; CRM that allows staff to track the patients history in hospital digitally.

              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Example 2 (broad): Nutrition is important for students to grow and learn. 
                Create a technology solution that helps improve student nutrition! This can be a mobile app for parents to track their child&apos;s nutrition, 
                a website for students to find healthy options on campus, or a tool for school administrators to track the nutrition of their students.
