Judging Philosophy Category How To Measure Pts
 In alignment with our values, the KYCombinator
hackathon is rewarding high-agency and highvelocity. Practically we're looking at
 speed,
execution, and impact. Why impact? We're indexing High Agency /
on progress - not just motion. LVL5
Did they do customer interviews (outside of their team) to
validate the hypothesis &
 show evidence?
Did they test this with a prospective customer or stand-in
outside of their team mid-development and then iterate?
(Showed evidence of test, learning, feedback implementation.)
• Have they had real customers/prospect (outside of their team)
use the version we're testing now?
Did the team exhibit high agency during the hackathon?

5 Minute Judging Flow:
•
2 Minutes: Hacker explains who's their
customer, what's their problem, what's the
solution?
Did they demonstrate skill or technique in
 their solution?
Did the team simplify and find a solution the saved time / Creativity,
Innovation & resources?
•
2 Minutes: Judge uses the product as a Did the team use a variety of technology and knowledge domain in
 order to solve the problem? /5 Skill customer
 1 Minute: Hacker shows judge the features they
might have missed
Is
 the solution unique or an interesting spin on something
existing (vs just a remake of something already out there)?
Hard Requirements:
.Pitch Deck Presentation & Clarity
Can the team clearly explain and demo their project under
pressure? (A
 5 year old should be able to understand the
customer, the problem and the solution in
 2 minutes.)
Can the team "sell" the solution?

• Working prototype w/ access link so that it can
be reviewed autonomously by
 judges in
deliberations Was the problem big and highly painful to a sizable group?
Considerations For Otherwise Equal Projects:
• Team considered contrast, font sizing, and Impact & Usefulness
• Did the solution solve the problem?
• Is
 the solution highly effective at solving the problem?
Is the solution "finished" i.e. can it
 be MVP?
Is
 there more opportunity to iterate and "go further"

WCAG guidelines to ensure their tech is
accessible, especially considering any guidelines
their target audience is
 likely to benefit from.
Product solves a massive problem in
 an Bonus overlooked market (ie mental health in
 the
military, food scarcity in
 rural & impoverished
urban communities, public transportation, etc)
Did the team have non-CS people with material impact to the
solution/presentation? +1
• Is
 the solution "open-source" so that other hackers can see the
project (i.e. public git repo)? +1
Was there an MVP within the first day of the hackathon? +1
Did the team "learn” during the hackathon? +1 (subjective)
Did the team have fun? +1 (subjective)
